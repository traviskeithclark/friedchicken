 <p>Fear Street: 1994
    I’m pathetically in the bag for arthouse horror. I like my dread slow-dripped and my scares born more out of cunning camera angles and disturbing imagery than shock-y jumps. Give me a film that’s as haunted by the traumas of its characters as by its killers, ghosts, and ghouls, and I’m already halfway onboard. And yet, I’ll confess to feeling a sense of relief on realizing that the kickoff Fear Street film wasn’t about more than it says on the package. Fear Street Part 1: 1994 is a nasty, effective slasher about a group of teenagers who come into contact with the curse that’s been plaguing their town of Shadyside, Ohio, for three centuries — one that has something to do with an accused witch, Sarah Fier, who was hanged in a settlement in the area back in 1666. At no point during the movie, which is the first installment of a trilogy that Netflix will be releasing (and I’ll be reviewing) over three weeks, is there a suggestion that the curse is a metaphor for repressed sexuality, or industrialization, or anything else. Sometimes a curse is just a curse, and this one has periodically sparked murder sprees in Shadyside, which is tattered and struggling, while the nearby community of Sunnyvale thrives.
    
    Horror is hardly the only film genre that’s fallen under self-exerted pressure to seek out greater, or at least more explicit, relevance, but it’s the one in which the gap between theme and execution can feel most glaring. The trouble with the “actually, it’s about trauma” or “actually, it’s about racism” approach is not the ambition to deal with these themes onscreen, but that so many recent movies (and TV shows) just stop after making the connection because they don’t actually have anything to say about these concepts. Where Get Out or The Babadook used horror to explore the razor-toothed hunger of white liberal (supposed) allies and the terror of feeling unable to trust your own mental state, plenty of other titles end up just pinning themselves to larger concepts in ways that range from clumsily obvious to grossly cynical. But 1994 feels untethered from these obligations. Its characters — band goth Deena (Kiana Madeira); her chatroom-loving younger brother, Josh (Benjamin Flores Jr.); her drug-dealing pals Kate (Julia Rehwald) and Simon (Fred Hechinger); and her ex, Sam (Olivia Scott Welch) — aren’t flat in terms of demographics or personal histories, but their differences exist within the context of the movie without being the triple-underscored point.
    
    
    Deena’s pining for and rage at Sam, who moved to Sunnyvale after her parents’ divorce and started dating a football player after Deena dumped her, is not the reason the curse is called down on these kids, but it is the film’s moody emotional core. The connections between the five are why they find themselves doing battle with a force that resurrects its past victims, among them an ax-wielding killer, a teen queen with a razor blade, and a stabby type in a skull mask. The latter is right out of Scream, as is the film’s first sequence, in which a disaffected B. Dalton employee named Heather (Maya Hawke) meets her gruesome end when closing up after hours in the Shadyside Mall. The trio of films, which were all directed and co-written by Honeymoon’s Leigh Janiak, are based on a series of R.L. Stine novels aimed at an older (which is to say, teenage) audience, and were originally slated to be part of an R-rated theatrical gamble at 20th Century Fox. On Netflix, the content of 1994, which includes some gnarly killing — Heather’s is on the milder end, and she doesn’t go easily — feels less remarkable than the quality of its filmmaking. That opening scene is shot in a retail expanse that’s as pretty as it is spooky — glowing in muted neon lighting, Heather goes down in a slow motion that lends a little lyricism to her pre-credits death.
    
    Those credits handily lay out a timeline of divided communities and occasional bloodletting that harkens as much back to horror’s history as it does the fictional twin towns. The ax-murderer, for instance, evokes Jason Voorhees, and will presumably show up in the next installment, 1978, which will take place in a summer camp that was demolished and replaced with the mall. But 1994 isn’t a pastiche, and it tries to evoke the actual decade in which it’s set and not an air-quotes version, with some nicely chosen needle drops (like the Cowboy Junkies’ inescapable-at-the-time cover of “Sweet Jane”) and restrained costuming choices.
    
    While the film has obvious touchstones, the influence it quietly but most steadily brings to mind is the terrific (and admittedly very arthouse!) It Follows. Like David Robert Mitchell’s film, 1994 takes place in a suburban world that’s familiar and also borderline dreamlike — an inciting hazing incident starts with headlights zooming in from afar in the night, as seen through the windows at the back of a school bus. And like It Follows, the curse in 1994 involves inexorable pursuers that the gang tries to fight off with MacGyver’d solutions, with parents remaining indifferently offscreen and most other adults revealed to be oblivious or skeptical. But Janiak’s film is saltier, soapier, and more pragmatic — it has sequels to dole out, after all. In 1994, it’s not sex that invites the monsters in, but making contact with evidence of the town’s original sin, one that we’ll presumably eventually witness. That may speak to a grander theme in its own right, but it’s not one any American horror film ever has to overreach for, not when its been there in the background all along. <em>By Alison Willmore</em> for Vulture MAgazine</p><br>

<p>M. Night is a pioneer in one way, as memory serves. May be apocryphal, but I recall an interview — in the wake of The Sixth Sense, during the lead-up to Unbreakable — in which he discussed the importance, with audience and critical attention then at a feverish peak, of defining the Shyamalan “brand.” (The dread “b”-word. Bury it six meters down beside that appalling “f”-word, “franchise,” if you would.) He saw himself as a commodity early on, and he still does. In a pre-taped introduction attached to his latest feature, Old, Shyamalan welcomes pandemic-scarred viewers back to theaters before referring to his 1999 supernatural blockbuster as his first film, conspicuously (for those of us in the know) sweeping his 1992 semi-autobiographical debut, Praying with Anger, and his 1998 search-for-God dramedy, Wide Awake (heavily compromised by Harvey Weinstein), under the rug.

    Shyamalan is a calculating sort, but why shouldn’t he be? Particularly since the “b”-word has so fully entrenched itself in the modern mo-pic lexicon. I shriveled inside when Lulu Wang, writer-director of the lovely 2019 family drama The Farewell, talked in a roundtable about her own need to define her “brand” on account of that film’s success. But there was an edge in how she said it, as if she was well aware that working within a supremacist system that has historically favored the white, the male, and the shamelessly monetized requires a warping of principles. It’s either one thing (play by the rules, with their feathery feints at progress) or the other (go home and seethe in obscurity). I like to think there are gradations in-between. But oppression tends to sully even the sharpest among us, until we weigh heavy on ourselves. What’s done to us, we perpetuate. Exploding that and living truly, adaptively free is a tall order.
    
    Shyamalan has admirably adjusted to the ebb and flow of his career — self-financing when the money wasn’t there, sticking to a fairly rigorous creative schedule (I recall another long-ago interview in which he discussed the importance of setting hard two-week deadlines for his various screenplay drafts), even finding time to tell “The Unlikely Story of How a Moonlighting Movie Maker Learned the Five Keys to Closing America’s Education Gap.” Doesn’t feel like he’s developed much overall, though. And isn’t that one of the prices of “branding”? You box yourself in, and the work goes flat — a shell without a spirit, even if, in Shyamalan’s case, there tend to be flickers of soul, and sometimes more, in each of his movies.
    
    Old fits the Shyamalan brand in that its moronic qualities are entangled with its moving ones. As usual, the former outweigh the latter. Though at its very occasional best, Old leans hard into both its sincerely emotive and garishly exploitative aspects, which doesn’t start happening (hey!) until the killer tropical coastline’s dirty secret (it ages you at the rate of a year every thirty minutes) becomes apparent to the gaggle of doomed vacationers at story’s center. Before then, it’s all half-baked signs and portents, with a push-in on a resort hotel’s pharmaceutical company sponsorship plaque (you can practically hear The Next Spielberg shouting, “this means something, people!”) illustrative of Shyamalan’s ineptitude when it comes to the actual “magic” of movies. He’s roundly terrible at hiding the obvious, unable to conceal a narrative tell in plain sight in the elegant way, for example, that De Palma choreographed the jeweled-brassiere switcheroo in Femme Fatale.
    
    Shyamalan shows his hand early and often, and not just in the stilted expository dialogue that makes his characters — here, a multi-culti/-disciplinary cross section of humanity, since we're once more in the collective trauma allegory mode of The Village and Lady in the Water — sound like the body-snatched. For some, this plays as a technique consciously utilized to foster unease. For me, it’s further evidence of the myopic mentality that undoes a number of Shyamalan features. He has his low bar (creatively, philosophically) and he sticks to it, what little movement there is, especially big-picture-wise, dictated solely and shallowly by the current zeitgeist and its attendant horrors.
    
    In macro, Old explores pandemic-era anxieties about the corporate entities that hold life-or-death sway over society. A ripe topic, sketchily explored in this context. Though I’ve read a few pointed postulations that the film ultimately takes misogynist and pro-police/anti-vax stances, which I think gives Shyamalan’s frivolous ethos way too much credit, while simultaneously illuminating the regressive attributes of his art, his oft-infamous twist endings (explaining away things that would better remain in the dread-inducing void) just the tip of that particular iceberg, and fodder for more interested parties than myself to explore.
    
    It’s on the micro level that I found myself moved by Old, inadvertently at first, as when Kathleen Chalfant was mercifully dispatched early on, and thus spared the grotesqueries that were Betty Buckley’s crosses to bear in The Happening and Split. But then the film got into a nice, tense groove, with the performers game for everything from accelerated tumor surgery to dementia-inflected cinephile trivia. (Answer: The Missouri Breaks.) It’s always a delight when Rufus Sewell plays a prick, and his rusty-knife comeuppance is one of Shyamalan’s most memorable kills, only outdone by the fate that befalls Abbey Lee’s trophy wife, Chrystal, whose rapidly decaying body is transformed, through circumstances too deliriously absurd to describe, into a kind of fleshy swastika. (Was it me who said Shyamalan didn’t have a flair for the politically acute? I recant!)
    
    Then there are leads Gael García Bernal and Vicky Krieps, playing unhappily-marrieds Guy and Prisca, who begin the movie as servants (hey, hey!) to their director’s innumerable bad ideas and finish it with a scene so profoundly poignant — certainly the equal of Robin Wright’s doorway conversation with Bruce Willis in Unbreakable — that Shyamalan’s own descriptor (“Bergman blockbuster”) feels apt instead of arrogant. Krieps is also the focus of Shyamalan and cinematographer Mike Gioulakis’s best recurring visual, a series of off-kilter compositions that puzzlingly (at first) emphasize her ear, yet pay off down the line with an extremely bittersweet audio cue (or the lack of one). I also adored the sequence on which a better filmmaker would have concluded, as Guy and Prisca’s speedily aged children, Trent and Maddox, accept their hours-left-to-live fate and, instead of succumbing to fear and loathing, build a sandcastle to pass the time. The Shyamalan brand returns soon after, with a slap-to-the-cerebrum silly finale. But by that point I was riding the lyrical high of Thomasin McKenzie maturing into Embeth Davidtz too much to care.<em>by Keith Uhlich</em></p> <br>

<p>If you thought that Julia Ducournau’s debut feature Raw was a sensational mating of family drama, vampirism, and campus coming-of-age, hold on to your hat for Titane, a thrilling, shifting game of two halves and many more subplots and set-pieces.

    There are shades of David Cronenberg’s Crash, Zoé Wittock’s Jumbo, and Shinya Tsukamoto’s Tetsuo: The Iron Man about Titane, but the craziest Palme d’Or winner in Cannes history is wilder and trippier than any of these predecessors. The pre-teen Alexia is already humming to motor engines, possessed of a titanium plate in her skull, and apt to physical expressions of affection toward automobiles by the time Ducournau’s eventful prologue has ended.
    
    As an adult, Alexia (Agathe Rousselle) writhes and gyrates on bonnets at car shows. Her fetishisation of metal finds expression in stabbing victims with a titanium spike and in a sexual act she performs with a car, a union that leaves her pregnant.
    
    
    On the run after a comically extensive murder spree, gorgeously and garishly shot by cinematographer, Ruben Impens, Alexia breaks her own nose and poses as Adrien, the son of soulful firefighter Vincent (Vincent Lindon), who disappeared a decade earlier. Vincent is happy to believe the lie, despite the fact that “Adrien” is quite obviously a woman; a woman who is pregnant by a car. 
    
      Strip away the body horror, feverish set-pieces, and fun with oil leaking from places where oil ought not to be, and there’s a touching family drama. In common with Raw, the outsized genre gestures articulate the outsized dramas and tensions that can define family life. The weird, wacky woman-machine mechanics equally parallel the splatter that characterises women’s bodies generally and childbirth in particular.
    
    Rouselle, who is catching a big break at 33, gives the kind of furiously committed performance one might expect from a talented actor who has waited far too long in the wings. Her turn is the French Queer Cinema’s answer to Kathy Bates in Misery or Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct. It’s exhaustingly physical under a mysterious robotic facade. Her deviant impulses and psychoses remain a tangled, enigmatic knot of dark hints. Her costar Vincent Lindon is equally dedicated. The veteran actor embarked on a two-year bodybuilding programme ahead of the shoot and exercises his acting muscles with similar determination.
    
    
    The final scenes transgressively lob missiles at hetereonormacy, progressive values, and happy endings. Nothing is safe and nothing is sacred in Julia Ducournau’s delirious new world. Rev up and get ready to run over everything the hotrods in Fast & Furious hold dear.<em>by Tara Brady</em> for The Irish Times</p> <br> <br>

<P>“This is London. Someone has died in every room in every building and on every street corner in the city.”

    Attending school for fashion design in London, Eloise (Thomasin McKenzie) is mortified by her new roommate Jocasta (Synnove Karlsen) and the worldliness of the other students outside the classroom. Not ready for the dormitory experience, Eloise answers an ad for a women-only room in the old Soho district from Ms. Collins (Diana Rigg) and settles in. Her dreams are filled with the glamor of the district in the 1960s… before realizing her reflection belongs to another woman, Sandie (Anya Taylor-Joy), who seems curiously aware of Eloise being along for the ride. After initially being inspired by her nightly visits into the past, dreams turn to nightmares as she realizes what horrors Sandie was exposed to by her agent Jack (Matt Smith) … and dangers that could reach Eloise even in the present.
    
    Writer/director Edgar Wright has a filmmaking style that has evolved with his career, from The Three Flavours Cornetto Trilogy (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, and The World’s End) to Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. After the excellent Baby Driver, his cinematic follow-up would be a psychological horror featuring The VVitch and “Queen’s Gambit” actress Anya Taylor-Joy but with Jojo Rabbit’s Thomasin McKenzie as the main character. The trailers tease something looking like time travel or a window to the past but in a way of letting evil into the present — not to mention Matt Smith chewing the scenery. A departure from Wright’s usual boy’s club fare and with period visuals that exude fashion and danger in equal amounts, what exactly has he cooked up this time?
    
    A connection with the dead is implied from the very beginning, but it’s unclear if it’s an interactive memory or an actual spirit, and the main character knows as little as the viewers. Is Eloise seeing ghosts no one else can, or is she stirring up echoes by giving them substance? The answer lies somewhere between Poltergeist’s Carol Anne and ParaNorman, but it feels new in Wright’s capable hands. Striking an unusual balance between crime and punishment while questioning comeuppance, Eloise and Sandie need an impossible solution to reach a satisfying end: a never-was relationship that will always be.
    
    Taylor-Joy’s Sandie is a confident muse whose happiness infects others, everything McKenzie’s Eloise lacks but is willing to learn. Early scenes swapping characters dancing with the same man are seamlessly choreographed, favoring practical effects over CGI as if the two were a single person. As the transference between the two women progresses, you can feel Sandie reaching out as she begins to slip away while Eloise tries in vain to save a shadow. Michael Ajao provides a friend in the real world when Eloise needs one the most, and Terence Stamp contributes in a surprising role that will have folks guessing.
    
    Soho combines elements of a haunted house tale, a classic ghost story, and a mystery half a century in the making, but the emotional connection is the film’s core. Wright’s work always includes strong relationships — it shouldn’t be a surprise how well this works — but having the central buddy element as two women bonding across time may be his most believable yet, and that’s saying something.
    
    Last Night in Soho is rated R for bloody violence, sexual content, language, brief drug material, brief graphic nudity, and inventing a new definition for the term “dead inside.”<em>from The Movie Crypt</em></P>

They’re not wrong. Valdimar Jóhannsson’s slow, absurdist quasi-creature flick is impossible to categorise, mashing up folk horror, Icelandic relationship drama and black comedy into something admirably different. The screenplay is co-written by Jóhannsson and Icelandic multi-hyphenate-but-singular-named Sjón, who has co-written Robert Eggers’ upcoming Viking flick The Northman. Lamb shares a lot in common with Eggers’ work, especially The Witch: a well-built sense of dread, an eeriness borne out of environment and a dark feel for the relationships between humans and animals. It doesn’t all come together, but it is the kind of film that benefits hugely from knowing nothing about it before you go in. So, if you’d like to bail now, be our guest.

        Lamb (2021)
        
        Jóhannsson sets the off-kilter mood from the get-go: a herd of horses emerge from a white mist and animals scarper at the sight of an unseen creature (Ingvar Lunderg and Björn Viktorsson’s sound design starts as it means to go on: consistently unnerving). The land belongs to Maria (Noomi Rapace) and her partner, Ingvar (Hilmir Snær Guðnason), hard-working Icelandic farmers who are comfortable in silence, a state perhaps triggered by a tragedy in their past.
        
        After a slow start, Lamb develops into an engaging exploration of nature versus nurture ideas.
        
        
        The film quietly follows the couple in their day-to-day routines of farm chores and minimal conversation — spending time with them is a bit of a patience-tester. Following the end of winter, Maria and Ingvar’s sheepdog (a brilliant performance by the late Panda, the Daniel Day-Lewis of canines) alerts them to a kerfuffle in the sheep-shed. The pair discover a human (body)-lamb (head) hybrid and, rather than run to the barren hills, decide to adopt the creature. They call her Ada.
        
        After a slow start, Lamb develops into an engaging exploration of nature versus nurture ideas. Maria and Ingvar raise Ada, an impressive mixture of practical and CG VFX, as their own, the idyllic scene threatened by the arrival of Ingvar’s wayward brother Pétur (Björn Hlynur Haraldsson, whose slow-blinking reaction to first seeing Ada is priceless).
        
        
        
        Jóhannsson, whose grandparents were Icelandic sheep farmers, has a feel for the milieu and, along with cinematographer Eli Arenson, creates stark, beautiful images that find discomfort in tableaux rather than whip-pans and jump-cuts. In its final third, the film enters more obvious creepy territory and, even if it can’t come up with a completely satisfying conclusion, Rapace’s compelling performance as the new mother striving hard to build a happy life keeps the absurdity palatable and engaging.
        
        Centred by a committed, affecting performance by Noomi Rapace, Lamb gets over its longueurs and missteps with interesting ideas, filmmaking craft and a unique tone of voice. Also includes some of the best animal acting of the year.<em>By Ian Freer</em>

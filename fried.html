    <p>Jollibee is a fast food restaurant with American-influenced items, as well as casual Filipino fare.

        Among the establishment's best sellers are the Yumburger, the house hamburger first introduced during their early days of operation; the Chickenjoy, a fried chicken meal introduced in the 1980s which comes in both regular and spicy versions; and Jolly Spaghetti, a Filipino sweet-style interpretation of spaghetti, which is being advertised as "the meatiest, cheesiest spaghetti". (The Jolly Spaghetti resembles that of Italian spaghetti, with its blanket of ragù, but under the ground beef are pieces of hot dog and ham.)
        
        Outside the Philippines, key products such as its chicken, spaghetti, and burgers are sold overseas but also offers localized products in its international markets such as chili chicken in Vietnam and nasi lemak in Brunei. In the Philippines, Jollibee serves Coca-Cola products for its beverages; in overseas markets, the chain serves Pepsi products.</p>

   <P>Popeyes began selling a chicken sandwich in August 2019 to compete with Chick-fil-A's similar sandwich. The company first launched the sandwich at Long Beach restaurant Sweet Dixie Kitchen, a locally-famous spot that had become known for reselling fried chicken that it had purchased at Popeyes.[27][28] The sandwich launched nationwide to all locations in the U.S on August 12, 2019, but had some advance openings at the beginning of 2019.[27]

    The marketing campaign, designed by advertising agency GSD&M started on August 12, 2019 with a tweet on Popeyes' Twitter feed. The new sandwich went viral immediately and prompted responses from nearly every fast food chain including McDonald's, Chick-Fil-A, and Wendy's.[29][30] Popeyes reported a 103% increase in traffic in the days following the launch of the sandwich.[31] The sandwich helped Popeyes gather an estimated $23 million in free publicity since its launch.[32] Popeyes stores routinely sold out of the sandwich and experienced long lines,[33] and man outside of a Maryland Popeye's chain was stabbed to death during a dispute over a cutting in line for a chicken sandwich.[34] Locations across the US were supposed to have enough materials to last them until the end of September. Instead, restaurants were almost entirely sold out after less than two weeks.[35] On August 27, approximately two weeks after the launch, Popeyes announced that it had officially sold out of the chicken sandwich across the country.[36] One person in Tennessee sued Popeyes, claiming that his inability to get the sandwich has caused him to be "hustled out of money", making Popeyes guilty of "false advertising" along with "deceptive business practices".[37] On October 25, 2019, Popeyes announced that the chicken sandwich would return to locations across the US on November 3.[38] Popeyes chicken sandwich is made of buttermilk-battered white meat on a brioche bun along with pickles and mayonnaise or spicy Cajun spread.</P>

    <p>Still my favorite spot in the city for food that tastes like home. I'm a Georgia boy born and raised in a town of about 9,000 in the country. Since moving to San Francisco it has been a STRUGGLE to find food that even comes close to reminding me of home. I've tried every restaurant in the city that bills itself as "Southern" or "soul food" or even Cajun/Creole (excluding CreoLa, which I intend to give a try soon). Brenda's Meat & Three is the only spot that actually gets it right. I prefer this spot to the main Brenda's French Soul Food. The novelty of a meat + three joint just feels like home. Ok - now the food. IT IS ALL GOOD. I haven't tried anything at this restaurant that I've had the (sad, sad) thought "hm... nice try" like I have elsewhere. That's saying something in SF!! If you want food that tastes like it was prepared by a chef whose Mawmaw taught them to cook - go here. Down to the pepper jelly served with the fried chicken. Real southern food. I love this spot. The only downsides to this place in my opinion are: I can get a just-as-tasty, albeit much sloppier, version of anything here from any ole meat and three or soul food spot at home for 1/2 the price. This one doesn't really bother me. It's San Francisco for one thing, and the setting and preparation of this food is much nicer than I'm used to. However, the one actual downside is the lack of fried okra on the menu. If Brenda's Meat + Three had fried okra it'd be damn near perfect for this displaced Southerner!</p>

      <p>Will definitely be frequenting this spot more this year! We usually don't have big breakfasts, so it took us a while to check this spot out but it had been on our hit list to try for some time. We had high expectations and they did not disappoint!

        I ordered the  2 Piece Meal (Leg & Thigh) with Bomb Mac and Cheese as my side. The portion size was plenty for me and left me so full and content. I prefer dark meat and their Fried Chicken was perfectly juicy and flavorful! Also now I understand why they call the Bomb Mac and Cheese bomb... it definitely is! Now to my favorite part, the Belgium Waffle! Super fluffy and the batter must have something special it in, because the flavor was better than any other waffles I've had.
        
        So glad that they are located close by, as its quickly become a staple for us!</p>

   <p>Over 60 years ago in the small community of Mason, Tennessee, Napoleon “Na” Vanderbilt created something amazing – fried chicken that could unite a community.  In an era of divisive racial attitudes the residents of Mason found that they could all – black and white – agree on how much they loved Na’s fried chicken.

 

    Such an amazing feat did not occur overnight.  After experimenting for several years in a local tavern, Na and his wife, Ms. Maggie, began selling their chicken, sandwiched between two slices of white bread, out of the back door of the tavern.  As demand grew, Na and Maggie were encouraged by local residents to build a freestanding restaurant.  Unfortunately, the Vanderbilt’s were of modest means and could not afford such an expansion; however, generous, chicken loving locals offered to supply them with the materials necessary to build their own restaurant.  Na, a skilled carpenter, built the restaurant on a piece of land he and Ms. Maggie owned on Highway 70 in Mason.  Maggie’s Short Orders opened its doors in 1973.  The building still stands today and still serves Na and Maggie’s amazing fried chicken.</p>
